# IT2810 group project 4
This is the repository for our solution to project 4. For this project we we were tasked with make a search engine connected to a database where it would get the data from through an API which we built ourselves.

## Folder structure
Since we made a frontend client and a backend api for this project we decided to seperate these modules into different folders with seperate dependencies. The frontend code resides in the `client` folder and the backend code resides in the `server` folder.

## Running the client, server and their respective tests
In their respective folders you will find instructions on how to run the different modules and their tests. Note that the api is running (hopefully) on a seperate server. Which means that you don't need to run the server locally for the client to function properly. The client is not dependent on the local server.
